Tracker V2 revised design doc

* Database as an API
    * Well documented, in a module, independent
    * Design goals:
         * Consistent method names
         * Keyword arguments
         * Consistent return values as named tuples
* Wrappers as decorators
    * One generic decorator for each function, so then switching out how the database interface is implemented only takes a few lines in the main decorator.
    * Wrappers handle all input and output, then hand off and receive cleaned data to the Database.
    * Bad data handling happens in wrappers
        * Show error message
        * Drop user back to the most recent menu
        * Let them renter the command and data again.
    * CLI wrapper menu and action system
        * All actions available always
        * One unified action parser
        * Actions as two letter commands, or full words
        * c create, m modify, d delete
        * u user, f field, e entry
        * h help <command>
        * Ex: c e for create entry
    * Confirm before deletions
