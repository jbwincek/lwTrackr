How would I do a rewrite
    * only one user
    * Fields, as lists of named tuples
    * unified way for interacting with things 
    * less spaghetti code
        * write the database as a well specified API that the wrappers implement
            * database should only deal with interacting with itself
                * is it even needed
            * database farming work out to the wrapper inverts the modularity and
              creates codependence
    * Action system: 
        * CLI wrapper based actions should be a result of what's implemented in 
          the database. 
    * feature creep potential items 
        * would be really cool if fields could be arbitrary 
        * decorators for CLI based wrapper? 

Database layout: 
    Field: [the time, the data, an additional label] 
    Field:
