[ ] Implement Database Saving
    [x] pick file type = json
    [ ] check if there are json errors when serializing namedtuples
    [x] decide if it needs to be encrypted / hashed
        [x] no to both
    [ ] database loading
        [ ] database bad parsing handling (in case file got changed since last)
    [ ] database saving 
[ ] Database as API rewrite
    [ ] Documentation
    [x] Skeleton procedures/functions
    [x] Think about if it makes sense to do save/load in the database or outside
        of it. It does, saving/loading in the database keeps the details

[x] Ruminate on the utlity of having such ad hoc decentralized input/output code
[ ] Keep naming consistent throughout: procudures do stuff, functions return stuff
